# UrsineMath
UrsineMath is a SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) accelerated linear math library.  It is a research project at heart, and is still very much so a work in progress.  Also this marked my first attempt tinkering with SIMD related.

UrsineMath utilizes SSE intrinsics up to 4.1.

These math libraries served as great learning resources and sources of inspiration:
